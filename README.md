## ü™Ñ 3. Usage

### 3.1. Create A New VIP

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** It is **RECOMMENDED** you read [VIP-00-0000][vip-00-0000] in order to understand the guidelines around VIPs.

When you have decided on the category and the indexing of your proposed VIP, copy the [vip-template.md](./vip-template.md) into the `vips/##` directory (where ## represents the category number referenced in [VIP-00-0000][vip-00-0000]).

Rename your file to the index you have chosen. This **MUST** use the form `####.md` and use padded zeroes if your index is below 1000, e.g. if your index is 27, the file to create will be `0027.md`.

### 3.2. Open A PR

Once you are ready for the VIP to be reviewed and open for discussion, open a PR and ensure the PR title is in the format:

````text
VIP-##-####: Title
````

The first digits (after `VIP-`), will be the number of category, followed by the index of your VIP, and then the capitalized title.

For example: `VIP-03-0200: Fungible Tokens`.
